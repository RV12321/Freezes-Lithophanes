				My name Is Tanner Freeze and I am the owner and founder of Freezeâ€™s Lithophanes. I began My journey in 3D printing back in 2016 
				when I signed up for a drafting class during my sophomore year at Central Cabarrus High School. I learned from my teacher how to 
				take my ideas and turn them into a 3d model on the computer and the next year I would start using 3D printers! Before I started 
				the second Drafting class and using 3d Printers, I was given my first printer for Christmas in 2018. Over the next couple years 
				I used 3D Printing as a hobby and got really good at it. 
				</p>
				<p class="whatido__p">
				Fast forward to 2020, I went to college at Embry Riddle Aeronautical University to study Aerospace Engineering then Covid Hit. 
				I was then given All the time I wanted to do the things i Loved. I then heard about PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) shortages 
				in hospitals and other places where there were doctors, and nurses fighting on the front lines. I decided to do something about it. 
				I ordered a second printer and I started printing face shields and donating them to hospitals, nursing homes, and anywhere else that 
				needed them. Thanks to my Mom, my story then went Viral and People wanted to know what they could do to help. Donations then started 
				pouring in, allowing me to purchase a third printer, and all the filament that was required to produce the amount of face shields I 
				was producing daily. I ended up donating over 500 face shields in the time I was printing them, officially starting my 3D printing career. 
				</p>
				
				<p class="whatido__p">
				In September of 2020, I printed some of my first lithophanes and thanks to my family and friends Loving them and recommending I sell them 
				I started to realize the potential and shifted my focus from printing models and toys to printing Lithophanes. As the years have passed I 
				have learned the ins and outs of printing Lithophanes and have come up with my own ideas including the Litho-Frame. Still, I believe I have
				just begun my journey and I'm very excited to see where this path leads!
